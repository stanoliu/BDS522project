# Descriptive Analysis
Below are the maps of the areas that are being compared.  The data was scrapped from redfin.com.  Filters were set to capture the following variables:  Price.Sold (how much the house was sold for), Bed (number of bedrooms), Bath (number of bathrooms), sqft (square footage of house), catchment (1 = inside PAS catchment / 0 = outside of catchment).  The data is for the last 3 years.  There are a total of 397 observations (197 inside the catchment and 200 outside the catchment).

Welch's 2 Sample t test to compare the two samples.  
```{r}
